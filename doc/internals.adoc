== Internal data structures

=== Binary format

The binary code is encoded as follows:

1 opcode byte followed by 0 or more data bytes

[source]
----
opcode [data] ...
opcode [data] ...
...

opcode bits 0..3: type
opcode bits 4..7: arg
----

There are 2 variants of opcodes:

- the 1st decodes into type + signed/unsigned 64 bit value (arg1)
- the 2nd decodes into type + unsigned 32 bit value (arg1, the size of the
  following byte array) + byte array (arg2)

The 1st group is for number-like data, the 2nd group for string-like data. Note that strings are not
zero-terminated.

if type < 5
  # variant 1
  if arg < 8
    arg1 = arg
  else	# arg >= 8
    arg1 = decode_num(arg - 7)	# 1..8 bytes
    # arg1 will be decoded as signed if type is 1 (integer), else unsigned
    # (if signed, bit 7 of the last byte is the sign bit)
  endif
else # type >= 5
  # variant 2
  if arg < 12
    arg1 = arg
  else	# arg >= 12
    arg1 = decode_num(arg - 11)	# 1..4 bytes
    # arg1 will always be decoded as unsigned
  endif
  arg2 = the following arg1 bytes	# arg1 may be 0
endif

decode_num(n): read next n bytes as little-endian number
----

For type codes see `types.def`.

The file has to start with the magic byte sequence `0x75 0x51 0x12 0xa9 0x42 0x7a 0xad 0x60`.
(Which decodes as a 7 char long special comment.)

Sample decoded byte sequences:

# hex [type] decoded value
00                                               [nil]  nil
51                                               [int]  5
