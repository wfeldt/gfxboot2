## Language reference

Comments start with '#' and extend to the end of the line.

To include some other source file, use the special `include` comment (note the double-`#`, and no quotes around the file name):

.Examples
```
## include foo.gs
```

Numbers are 64 bit signed integers. Numerical and string constants are given in a C-like way.

.Examples
```
123
-456
0x4567
"Hi there\n"
'\033'
'\x1b'
'\u20ac'
```  

Strings are not zero-terminated and can contain any data (including zeros). Use `\xNN` to set arbitray binary values.
Use `\uNNNN` or `\UNNNNNNNN` to include UTF8-encoded Unicode characters.

.Examples
```
"1 Euro = 1 â‚¬\n"
"1 Euro = 1 \u20ac\n"
"1 Euro = 1 \xe2\x82\xac\n"
```

Logical operations return values of type bool. They are not identical with integers.

.Examples
```
true
false
```

There is a special value nil. It is not the same as 0.
